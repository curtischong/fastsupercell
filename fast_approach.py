# can we use a linear transformation so instead of a parallelepiped, we create the graph in a euclidian plane?
# this way, when calculating the distances between two atoms, we can use a bitmask
# maybe diff axis will have diff "length" cause of the mapped distances
# now we can generate the edges VERY fast
# a future optimization would be to use sram instead
